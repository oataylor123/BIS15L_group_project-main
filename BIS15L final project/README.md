GradeCalc_BIS2C_ShinyApp
==========================

This is an R Shiny app which calculates grades and produce report for students in BIS2C. 
The current version is based on Winter 2021 syllabus.

Current functionality:
- Ask a student to type the grades in the numeric input boxes. After clicking "Submit", a report is produced.
- Clear the input form by clicking "Clear".
- Calculate the total points earned and the percentages before and after the grade adjustment (i.e. dropping the lowest quiz).
- Show progress plots of the assignment grades before and after the adjustment. 
  Each plot shows the individual grades and cumulative grades.
- Save the grades that a user last submit for each session, though I am not sure yet how to get access through shinyapps.io.
